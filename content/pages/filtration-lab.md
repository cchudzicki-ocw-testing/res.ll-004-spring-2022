### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

Filtration has everyday applications. For example, coffee filters filter coffee of various grinding levels and particle size. 

#### Questions to Consider

Why might we need to separate dirt from water? What uses do filtered water and the extracted dirt have? Does your approach to this problem change depending on how we, the clients, will use the filtered water and dirt? What if it wasn’t water and dirt, but water and gold – would that change your answer? Take some time to write down one or two sentences to answer each of these questions.

## Step 2: Considering Constraints & Gathering Materials

Now that you have considered some of the “whys”, it is time to lay out the constraints of this engineering problem. Every engineer must learn to work within the constraints of a project or problem and find creative solutions to each unique situation. There are two major constraints for this filtration problem: materials and budget. We, the clients, only want filtration systems built out of a certain set of materials, and we cannot spend an infinite amount of money to build these systems. As a result, here are the materials you can use, and how much each of them costs. You don't have to use every item on the list, and you can add more as long as you give them an appropriate cost.

### Materials

Quantities vary based on your experiment so consider these to be example amounts. Not all of these materials will be used depending on how you design your experiment.

Supporting Items: (Use as needed)

- Measuring cups and measuring spoons
- 3-5 clear plastic or paper cups ($1.00 each)
- 3-5 straws ($0.50 each)
- 1-2 square feet of cardboard
- 1 foot of plastic wrap ($4.00 per foot)
- 1 foot aluminum foil ($2.00 per foot)
- 3-5 rubber bands ($0.50 each)
- 6-12 toothpicks ($0.01 each)

Filtration mediums: (Pick 1-2)

- 5-15 cotton balls ($1.00 each)
- 3-5 paper towel sheets ($0.25 per sheet)
- 1-2 cups of sand ($1.00 per cup)
- 1-2 cups of aquarium rocks, small rocks, wood chips, or gravel ($2.00 per cup)
- 1 cup of activated charcoal (not recommended for younger students) ($5.00 per cup)

Materials to filter: (Pick 1-2)

- 1 cup of flour ($0.25 per cup)
- 1 cup of coffee grinds ($1.00 per cup)
- 1 cup of dirt
- 1 cup of cornmeal ($0.50 per cup)

## Step 3: Design

Now that the problem is laid out and the available materials and costs are known, you can move on to the next phase of the engineering process: prototyping. To start, we (the clients) would like you to design two “paper prototypes”: one budget version that is cheap, and one that spares no expense. Prototyping is a critical phase in engineering, allowing you to determine what might work and what might not. Paper prototypes let you do this quickly and cheaply, and communicate your designs to others.

**Create two different “paper prototypes” for two different filters at a low and high price point. On two pieces of paper, list the materials used, the total cost of the materials, and a sketch of how the materials would fit together to create a filter. On the sketch, indicate where the dirty water enters, and where clean water exits. Finally, write down the pros and cons of each prototype.**

If you’re doing this activity with a class, take some time to discuss each team’s paper prototypes. After discussing with the class, you can revise your paper prototypes if you have new ideas. If you are just doing this activity by yourself, you can discuss your paper prototype with a friend or family member, explain to them why you made the decisions you made, and then make revisions.

## Step 4: Build

Now it’s time to build the filtration system! You are going to build the “low price” system. As you do, you’ll have to write down how you are building it. Documentation is critical for every engineering project; engineers work in large teams, with team members leaving and joining as the project goes on. With solid documentation, new engineers can easily understand the project, and the client will know how to use the product when your team is done.

**Build: Gather the materials listed on your “low price” paper prototype, and construct the system according to your sketch. As you do, write down each step of construction in detail, so that somebody else could do it using just the materials, the sketch, and the step-by-step instructions.**

## Step 5: Experiment & Evaluate

  
Finally, it is time to test the system! Testing is one of the final hurdles before your engineering project can be used by the client or the public, and it is critically important to perform it carefully. Here is the first thing to be careful of: **DO NOT DRINK THE FILTERED WATER**. Even if your filter is perfect, and the water looks clean and clear after filtration, it still isn’t safe to drink. This activity is about learning the engineering process, so that maybe one day you can become the next expert engineer for filtering safe drinking water. It does not teach you how to effectively filter dirty water so that it is safe for humans or animals to drink.

***Evaluate*****:** Combine clean water and the materials you want to filter (e.g. dirt, coffee grinds, etc.) in a 32:1 ratio (one quart of water for every two tablespoons of material). Use a measuring cup and measuring spoons. Then, take two cups of the murky water, and slowly pass it through the filter, collecting the filtered product that comes out of the system. As a class (or individually, if you are outside of a classroom), rank your filtered product on the following scale:

> 1. No material remains (looks like drinking water – but do not drink it!)
> 2. About one-quarter of the material remains
> 3. About half of the material remains
> 4. About three-quarters of the material remains
> 5. All material remains (like the original muddy water)

You have now successfully built a water filtration system! Take some time to discuss as a class – or with your friends and family – what worked and what did not. If you got a score of 0, what was so successful? If you got a score of 5, what could you have done differently?
